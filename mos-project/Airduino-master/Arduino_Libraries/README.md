# Required Arduino Libraries
These libraries are the code that is required to interface the Arduino MEGA 2560 with the screen, the multiselect knob, and the air data chips.  These should be downloaded in zip format, and installed in accordance with the manual or standard Arduino practice.  If you do not do this, you will not be able to compile and upload the code to your Airduino you have built.
